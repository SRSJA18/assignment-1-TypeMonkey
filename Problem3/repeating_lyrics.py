Problem 3 Extension: Repeating Lyrics

Many songs use repitition. We can use variables to manage that repetition when printing out the lyrics.

Here is the chorus for Rick Astley's 'Never Gonna Give You Up'

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Here is a program that outputs that chorus:
'''

root = "Never gonna"
print (root, "give you up")
print (root, "let you down")
print (root, "run around and desert you")
print (root, "make you cry")
print (root, "say goodbye")
print (root, "tell a lie and hurt you")
print # blank line

# TODO Option 1: Choose a song or chorus and write the program to output the lyrics using variables
# TODO Option 2a: If you know about Python lists you could simplify the program above using a loop.
# TODO Option 2b: If you completed 2a you may have noticed that all but one line has the form
#                'Never gonna _____ you ____' with the second blank optional. Can you rewrite the program
#                using variables? How will you handled 'say goodbye'?
