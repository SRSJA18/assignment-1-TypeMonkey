Problem 5: User Input

In this exercise, we will ask the user for his/her first and last name and date of birth and print them out formatted.
Recall that you can get input from the user using the command input("text").

Example Output:

Enter your first name: Chuck
Enter your last name: Norris
Enter your date of birth:
Month? March
Day? 10
Year? 1940
Chuck Norris was born on March 10, 1940.

To print a string and a number in one line, you just need to separate the arguments with a comma (this works for
any two types within a print statement). The comma adds a space between the two arguments. For example, the
lines:

mo = 'October'
day = '20'
year = '1977'
print mo, day, year

will have the output:

October 20 1977
