Problem 2: Tic Tac Toe

Write a program using print that, when run, prints out a tic-tac-toe board.

The purpose of this exercise is to make sure you understand how to
write programs using your computing environment; many students in introductory courses experience trouble with
assignments not because they have trouble with the material, but because of some weird environment quirk.
