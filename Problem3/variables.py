Problem 3: Variables

Recall that variables are containers for storing information. For example;

Program Text:
a = "Hello, world!"
print(a)

Output:
Hello, world!

The = sign is an assignment operator which tells the interpreter to assign the value "Hello, world!" to the
variable a.

Program Text:
a = "Hello, world!"
a = "and goodbye..."
print(a)

Output:
and goodbye...

Taking this second example, the value of a after executing the first line above is "Hello, world!". But, after
executing the second line, the value of a changes to "and goodbye...". Since we ask the program to print out
a only after the second assignment statement, that is the value that gets printed. If you wanted to save the values
of both strings, you should change the second variable to another valid variable name, such as b.

Variables are useful because they can cut down on the amount of code you have to write. In homework 1.py, write
a program that prints out the tic-tac-toe board from exercise 1.2, but which uses variables to cut down on the
amount of typing you have to do. Hint - how many different variables should you need?

Expected output:

# TODO 2. Use print statements with variables to output a tic tac toe board.
